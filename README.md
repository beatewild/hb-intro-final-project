Menu Calculator

The Menu Calculator calculates the restaurant check plus tax and tip. The restaurant sells food and drinks. All the items are in a dictionary. The tax is 8.75%. The tip options are: 15%, 20%, 25%

To interact with the user I ask him/her what food, drinks ... he/she had. The answers are collected in a list.
