Menu Calculator

The Menu Calculator calculates the restaurant check plus tax and tip. We have lists of food and drinks as dictionaries. The tax is 8.75%. The tip options are: 15%, 20%, 25%

To interact with the user we ask him/her what food, drinks ... he/she wants. The answers are collected in a list.

Furthermore the Menu Calculator calculates how many calories the use has ordered: calories in food and calories in drinks build together the total of calories.
